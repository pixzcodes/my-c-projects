# My C Projects
I made this repo just to house my C projects while I am learning C programming.
I am working with a copy of *C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition* by K.N. King.
The main reason I want to learn C is because I'm very interested in low level solutions to different problems. Computer graphics and systems programming are two of the main things I am interested in looking into. One of the other reasons I am learning C is that it gives me a better understanding of different systems in other languages.
